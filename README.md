#### The exploration of AI education based on large models It is often said that education should be tailored to the individual and catered to their aptitudes; however, the prevailing standardized models, curriculum design, and evaluation systems may not adequately accommodate the unique personalities, interests, and strengths of every student, potentially resulting in some feeling suppressed or defeated within rigid educational frameworks.

#### Moreover, there exists a significant disparity in the allocation of educational resources, with considerable differences between regions and urban-rural areas, encompassing teacher quality, teaching facilities, course resources, among other factors. The issue of education costs also impacts educational equity and societal mobility.

#### This project aims to leverage large AI models to analyze each student's individual data, including learning habits, comprehension abilities, preferences, and mastery levels of knowledge, thereby creating highly precise user profiles. Subsequently, it endeavors to provide personalized teaching plans to contribute to the reform of education.

#### We warmly welcome all those who are passionate about this cause to join us in exploring these possibilities!
